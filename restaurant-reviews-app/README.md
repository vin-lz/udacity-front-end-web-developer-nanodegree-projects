# Restaurant Reviews App


## Instruction

In this project, a static webpage is converted to a mobile-ready web application. A static design that lacks accessibility is converted to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker is added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

##How to run

* Run the server with "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000" in terminal.
* Simply just load the `index.html`.
