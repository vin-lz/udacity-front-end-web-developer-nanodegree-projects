# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

## Instructions

In this game you have a player and a few bugs. The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the bugs. The player can move left, right, up and down, controlled by the keyboard. The bugs move at random speeds on the paved block portion of the game board. Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting position. Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won.

### Each turn:

* The player use the left, right, up and down keys on keyboard to control the move of the charactor.
* Avoid collision with bugs that run from the left to the right of the screen.
* Win the game when the charactor reach the water.

To start the game, simply just load the `index.html`.
